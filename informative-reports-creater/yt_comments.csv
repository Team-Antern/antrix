UgzwFq-GHbgEf142oxt4AaABAg.9RaOx-q5IHM9STymGEsviT," @fake garlic  Hey, I will completely disagree with you on some points, 
Firstly Watch the Sections and Then Tell Anything, You folks are just seeing some parts and coming to the comments part and spreading misconception, now let me clear your points, The course titled is ""ML for Beginners"", So, I explained SVM In very much In-depth even In very layman terms but still some last parts are bit confusing because it is for beginners and usually SVM is retaught more in depth when we study ML In Advanced, So better be reading the titles and course content rather than passing the judgement of yours.  

and from your second point my doubt totally cleared that you have watch only some minutes and then been jealous or offended and came in comment, y_i is taught in starting notations part where it is ground truth and y_hat is model output. 
and about being summation, regularization term, these are taught in depth derivation of each equation graphically which is mostly not taught, Idk why people come in comment and misguide others. 

I know you're someone who sells ML courses and seeing such a great content spreading misguidance and do you know after teaching the theory part only I go to the implementation from scratch and with library.  

Some Errors which is done are already Listed on Errata Page of this course, I am human not a someone else, Mistakes are made by me as well, but I corrected by making a errata page. and about being Gradient descent, Should I laugh on this? in Starting I spent lot of amount of time in starting talking about Gradient descent, so better to see that and I also highlighted one error over here in Errata Page.  

And About Math Skills,  I accept my some mistakes in starting that I made by myself and already highlighted before someone says. and about my handwriting Sometimes my handwriting goes well sometimes not, so I use Huion Tab, I have bit difficulty but still I am trying.
